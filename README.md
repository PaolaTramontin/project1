Project Title: Game of Thrones Memory Game

Concept:
The game I created is a memory card with 6 total matches. The user can choose between playing by themselves or with another player. The single player mode is not timed. Therefore, and the user can take their time finding all the matches. The 2 player mode is timed to give the users a more competitive experience. In addition, I created a reset button so that the game can restart at any given time.  


Technologies Used:

-HTML
-CSS 
-Javascript


Overview:
My goal was to create a memory card game with a single or 2 player mode. With the knowledge I gained from class, I thought of combining event listeners with setTimeout(). When the div is clicked the image that was hardcoded into that div would appear. In terms of page layout, I wanted the game to be the primary focus. I used a lighter color for the background and a darker color for the game container. In addition, I did not want the user to scroll up and down. I felt like it took away from the game layout and it felt inconvenient.

Challenges:
My main challenge was shuffling the divs inside the container. At the beginning of the project, I hardcoded the images to each div insteaf of putting them into an array. This meant, my game could only be played once. To fix this issue, I utalized flexbox! I was able to put the div order numbers into an array. By doing that, I was able to shuffle order numbers and manipulate the location of the divs within the parent container.
